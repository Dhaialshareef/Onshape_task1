# part 1
Design of the Part and Its Uses 
This part features a conical pointed shape with a hollow cylindrical top, offering several potential uses, such as:

A cap or head for a cylindrical product.
A shell tip or experimental model for aerodynamic testing or prototyping.
A component in a mechanical device.
Tools Used in Onshape:
Revolve: To create the pointed conical bottom.
Extrude Add: To add the cylindrical top section.
Extrude Remove: To hollow out the interior of the top.


Benefits of the Design:
A simple and flexible design suitable for practical or artistic applications, such as projectile tips or experimental models.

#part 2
Extrude:
The Extrude tool was used to create the basic shape of the cup by adding material in the vertical direction.
Revolve:
The Revolve tool was used to shape the circular form of the cup around a fixed axis. This tool is important for creating round objects like cups.
Fillet:
The Fillet tool was used to round the edges of the handle and the cup itself, giving it a smooth and aesthetic finish.
Shell:
The Shell tool was used to create a hollow interior inside the cup and to define the wall thickness between the inner and outer surfaces of the cup.
Dimensions:
The Dimensions tool was used to measure and set the precise dimensions such as the inner and outer diameters of the handle, the height of the cup, and the wall thickness.
